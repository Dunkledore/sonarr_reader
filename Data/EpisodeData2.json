    "overview": "Explorer Ed Stafford struggles to establish himself on a remote uninhabited Fijian island. Arriving with nothing, he has to quickly establish his priorities of water, shelter, food and fire to have any chance of surviving his 60-day challenge. Living mainly on coconuts, Ed frantically searches the island for a reliable water source and for food, eating anything that comes his way - including a raw gecko. As his only water source dries up, Ed suffers from dehydration before the rain comes and gives him the boost he needs to finally make a much-needed fire.",

To make matters worse, he’s still constantly hungry and dehydrated. As Ed’s physical health deteriorates, so does his mental state, and loneliness begins to take its toll. He’s forced to dig deep to find the strength to keep going.",
